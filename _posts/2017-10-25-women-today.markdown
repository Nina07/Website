	Ladies, do you recognize the women from the picture above ? They are none other than our beautiful disney princesses, with a hint of 21st century and a dash of awesomeness :*<br>
	What is it like, being a woman today. Is it following the <b>#metoo</b> trend, or is it or about the <b>#heforShe</b> campaign ? Is it okay if you are a feminist, but you don’t mind compromising a little bit for the man you love ? Or is being married by 26, having a family by 30 too much of a cliche now.<br>
	Who are you? Let me help.<br>
	<b><i>Brave. Beautiful. Bold. Tough. Compassionate. Intelligent. Achiever. Sassy.</i></b><br>
	But not just that. Women are also,<br>
	<b><i>Ditzy. Clumsy. Impatient. Egoistic. Judgemental. Lame. Shrill.</i></b><br>
	And you know what all of this makes them ? It makes them Real. It makes them exist. I could have just chosen the good qualities today, and masked the bitter ones. But then I thought no more idolizing. No more worshipping. It’s time to get real, it’s time to face the truth!<br>
	Us chickas, we love to live our life on the edge. We like to experiment. We like to indulge. We like to think with a clear head, make a decision, and then act on it in no time! Because who here has any time to waste anyway. Our edge can be going on a road trip to Ladakh, or sitting on our desk and creating something awesome out of nothing. It can also be about joining a cult, being a hippy and living life with people who are as high on joys as we are. And other times, it can be marrying that idiot, traveling the world with him and then loving those little munchkins that the two of them could call their own. That’s right, I’m talking about those labradoodles.<br>
	We can be anything. And everything. And not because the world told us to be, because we chose to be.<br> 
	Be awesome. Be you!<br>
