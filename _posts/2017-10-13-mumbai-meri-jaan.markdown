<p>So..I am here to talk about my big move to the city of Dreams, Adventures, Experiences and what not, Aamchi Mumbai baby !
Well, my love for Mumbai is also because that was my first move away from my native, but man, who will not love Mumbai. I loved each and every corner of it. It transformed me into a new person, a more confident, less judgmental, more accepting of things. I owe my current self to that city. I spent a good one year there, not that long I know, but dude, in just one year I became the so much better version of me, I can’t imagine how much more of awesome I would have ended up if I was still there! It’s only been a month since I left my baby. I’m in Bangalore now.</p>
<p>I hail from Indore, to my fellow Indorians, kya chal riya h bhiya logo ? Sab maje me na ? Thodi Sev le aana koi mere liye Indore se aa riya hoto ;)
Indore, no doubt is my first love, the city has peace, food cooked with my mother’s lovely hands, scoldings from Papa, and my school and college life enveloped with itself ! Schools years are the golden times of your life <'3'
Coming back to the topic, I’m trying to give you some insight on Indore. Indore is referred to as Mini Mumbai, who slowly is turning into the corporate and developed city day by day. Still far away from the night life culture, not the casual and safe one at least ( no offense Indori bhai logo ). The people from Indore have still not accepted the fact that the younger generation wants to live life on their own terms, party like crazy and be independent, which is basically what it is trying to learn from Mumbai I believe ( Mini Mumbai after all ). 
So what happened when an ambivert, who tends more towards introverts, moved from Indore to Mumbai ?
Truck load of awesomeness unleashed itself !!
Mumbai has a charm. It accepts you. It gives you wings. It gives you space. You can come as a normal hard-ly(:P) working Engineer, and leave as a party animal who is drunk with stories, experiences, unbreakable bonds. You learn to live and let live, because dude, itni bheed h kisike paas time nahi h to bother themselves with your issues :D</p>

On a serious note, I credit this as the best thing that I learned from Mumbai. Not being judgmental. It’s your life, you can choose to do whatever you want with it, who the hell am I to judge ? I didn’t walk in your shoes and feel what you felt. No two people can be the same so it’s completely worthless to even begin comparing or judging them for their actions. Choti si zindagi h, dusre kya sochte h ye parwah krke kyu time waste kre?</p>

<p>I wore the dresses I’d never worn, went to places I never went to, talked my heart out with strangers and they didn’t judge me, and all this while feeling completely safe, be it any hour of the night. People are helping. Food is awesome, well Indore se thoda kum :P
My fashions senses elevated. I found good friend in people way younger than me, with the same or maybe even more level of maturity than me, people that I’ll remain in touch with for the rest of my life. I started taking responsibility for myself, running household chores, not shying off things. I started getting building-gasms :D, seriously man the infras in Mumbai are breath taking *_*</p>

<p>And man how can I forget, all the big events, concerts, there’s everything in Mumbai. Life me weekends kum padh jayenge, but events khatam nahi honge. I attended live stand up comedy shows ( Kanan & Biswa ), attended the Comic Con 2016 *_*, Coldplay k time gareebi aagyi thi ;_;, nonetheless, Ed bhaisaab aarahe h, Nov’17 ;)
Last but not the least, the places <'3', Carter Road, Bandra Bandstand <'3'</p>

<p>
Honestly, I think everyone should go and live in Mumbai, for at least once in their life!<br>
By now anyone reading this must have realized I am pretty darn crazy about Mumbai. And I can seriously go on, but I think this is enough for the first blog! Thank you for bearing with me :)
