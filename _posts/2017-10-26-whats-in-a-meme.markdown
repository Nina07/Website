<p>
	What sorcery are these memes anyway? If you try to lookup their meaning on Google, it goes as <i>an image, video, piece of text, etc., typically humorous in nature, that is copied and spread rapidly by Internet users, often with slight variations.</i><br>
	That doesn't sound like something that's a big deal. So what's with all the craziness about them!<br>
	Let me give you a description.<br>
	Memes are emotions. Memes connect. Memes are ice breakers. Memes are a proof that people miles away from you connect as equally with you as your neighbour. Memes are fun.<br>
	Memes are love &lt;3
	There are so many categories in memes, one for every emotion. This tempts me to make one; 
	<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}one-does-not-simply-create-a-meme-and-not-share-it-with-the-world.jpg); height: 32rem;"></div><br>
	<b>Sharing is caring &lt;3</b><br>
	I am absolutely crazy about memes. Be it any situation, I can define it with a meme. If there's a new meme in the market, I must have it. I must share it, make my people enjoy it. It's an addiction :3

<p>Stay tuned for more!</p>

	Cheers,<br>
